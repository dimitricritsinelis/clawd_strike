# Gameplay / Balance Notes (10P FPS)

## Intended Combat Ranges
- Main bazaar: mid-range with intermittent cover beats and a controlled centerline
- Side halls: short-range flank duels with quick rotations back to mid

## Spawn Safety
- Spawn plazas include 2x cover anchors each (`spawn_cover`) to prevent immediate spawn wipes.
- Ensure **no** single sightline can continuously watch both spawn exits.

## Rotation Philosophy
- Mid cuts provide **fast** lane rotation.
- North cuts provide **counter-rotation** closer to the hero arch.
- If flanks become too dominant:
  - reduce cut visibility (partial occluders)
  - add a “soft gate” (cover cluster) near side hall approaches

## Prop Pocket Tuning
Prop pockets should:
- break LoS every ~12–18m in main lane (without blocking)
- give players a stop-and-peek rhythm (move → cover → move)

Avoid:
- single dominant headglitch facing long lane
- props that force single-file movement

## Competitive Readability
- Use signage and color accents to support callouts.
- Keep silhouettes consistent: doors, stalls, cover heights.
