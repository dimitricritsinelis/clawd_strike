# Art Direction & Dressing Notes

## Target Look
Warm, sunlit stone bazaar with strong material readability:
- Sun-baked stone walls with plaster patches
- Wood shutters and doors, worn edges
- Fabric canopies/banners overhead to create dappled lighting
- Dense but controlled market clutter along the edges

## Dressing Rules (Gameplay First)
- **Do not** intrude into the **6.0m clear travel zone** in the main bazaar.
- Keep flank lanes readable: props should create cover beats, not labyrinths.
- Avoid clutter that creates unpredictable “head height” micro-cover.

## Stall Strip Dressing
Recommended composition:
- Back wall: shop shutter modules + signage
- Mid strip: stall tables + rugs + pottery clusters
- Floor clutter: baskets/sacks (low collision, low profile)

## Side Hall Dressing
- More utilitarian: crates, barrels, service doors, occasional alcoves
- Keep corners clean at connectors and cuts

## Landmark Dressing
- **Mid well/fountain**: unique silhouette + ambient audio (low)
- **Hero arch**: unique stonework + hanging banners; visible from BZ_M3 approach

## Lighting Notes
- Canopies should create “striped” shadow breakup in the main lane.
- Keep spawn plazas evenly lit (avoid dark corners that hide spawn exits).
- Use warm practicals (lanterns) as secondary accents, not primary visibility drivers.
