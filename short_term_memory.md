## Task Cards

### STM-20260309-154233-codex | active | ui-flow | Loading-screen champion badge typography
Owner: codex
Branch: codex/champion-badge-font
Goal: Keep the loading-screen shared-champion badge typography update ready for review or typography-only follow-up.
Done when: Review lands or any requested typography-only adjustment is applied without moving badge placement or alignment.
Authority:
- apps/client/src/styles.css
Files:
- apps/client/src/styles.css
Context:
- Only loading-screen shared-champion badge typography changed.
- Placement and alignment stayed unchanged.
- Longer names ellipsize sooner because badge width stayed fixed.
Next:
- Wait for review or make a typography-only adjustment if requested.
Blockers:
- none
Recent Notes:
- 2026-03-09T15:42:33Z | claim | Claimed task.

### STM-20260309-223704-codex | blocked | docs | Lean AGENTS and mirror docs
Owner: codex
Branch: map-dev
Goal: Keep the STM-based policy surfaces lean by trimming AGENTS.md and removing duplicate authority prose from the mirror docs.
Done when: AGENTS.md stays under 6 KB, mirror docs stay lean, DEC-001 and DEC-002 stay durable, and the required validation gates pass.
Authority:
- AGENTS.md
- docs/decisions.md
Files:
- AGENTS.md
- README.md
- docs/decisions.md
Next:
- Resolve the blocked build gate or confirm it is unrelated to the docs rewrite.
Blockers:
- none
Recent Notes:
- 2026-03-09T22:37:09Z | blocker | Blocked on pnpm build hanging after Vite reports 96 modules transformed.
- 2026-03-09T22:37:09Z | progress | Trimmed AGENTS to 79 lines and 6141 bytes; cleaned README and CLAUDE; rewrote DEC-001 and DEC-002.
- 2026-03-09T22:37:04Z | claim | Claimed task.
